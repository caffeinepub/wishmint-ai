# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a top-left creator credit in the Hero top bar and apply a light UI polish pass to make the site feel more professional while keeping all existing behaviors intact.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a top-left text label in the Hero top bar that reads exactly “Created By Arion Zi”, aligned opposite the existing authentication controls on the right.
- Polish UI consistency across major sections (Hero, Generator, Templates, Pricing, Examples, FAQ, Legal, Footer) by refining spacing, typography hierarchy, alignment, and shared component styling (e.g., cards/buttons/links) without changing any feature behavior or gated-flow logic.

**User-visible outcome:** The landing page shows “Created By Arion Zi” in the top-left of the Hero header while auth controls remain in the top-right, and the overall page layout/typography feels more consistent and professional across sections.
