  "summary": "Upgrade “WishMint AI” into a premium, viral, emotional birthday wish generator with a professional startup SaaS feel, including improved hero UX, richer generator controls, enhanced output cards (copy + share), a separate standalone premium card designer module (Canva/Instagram-style) with multiple animated themes, deep customization, photo support, social exports (including 9:16 Instagram Story), plus template studio, examples/testimonials/features sections, social viral tools (WhatsApp, Instagram story format, QR codes), SEO meta tags, relaxed auth (generate without login; login for saving/premium), and add two new sections: (1) a community feed where users can post templates/stickers for others to view and subscribe/follow, and (2) buy/sell marketplace features.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Single-file offline-first implementation: all HTML/CSS/JS in one index.html; template-based text generation (no external APIs/keys).",
    "Use wa.me URL with encodeURIComponent for WhatsApp sharing.",
    "Use HTML canvas rendering for downloadable share card images.",
    "Google Sign-In/OAuth requires external network access and third-party integration; this may conflict with fully offline-first/no-external-dependency goals and needs an explicit decision on allowed online-only features.",
    "Relax gated UX flow: generation is allowed without login; only saving, premium template exports, and advanced features require authentication.",
    "Add QR code generation locally (client-side) with no external API dependencies to preserve offline-friendly behavior.",
    "Add SEO meta tags (title/description) directly in index.html head.",
    "User chose Option 2: implement the premium Canva/Instagram-style card system as a separate standalone card designer module inside the app (not just upgrading the existing card output flow).",
    "Google Analytics (gtag.js) requires loading scripts from googletagmanager.com; this introduces an external network dependency and may conflict with offline-first/no-external-dependency goals—decide whether analytics is allowed as an online-only enhancement."
