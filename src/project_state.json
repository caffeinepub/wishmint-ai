  "summary": "Shift WishMint AI toward a production-ready, scalable premium monetized birthday/emotional message platform with Razorpay subscriptions (India payments), tiered plans (Free/Pro/Creator) with automatic feature locking, enhanced export formats (PNG/PDF/MP4), Surprise Link experiences, voice + reel generation, conversion-focused homepage updates, user dashboard, and creator marketplace upgrades including payouts/analytics—potentially requiring an online backend stack beyond the current offline-first IC-only approach.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Single-file offline-first implementation: all HTML/CSS/JS in one index.html; template-based text generation (no external APIs/keys).",
    "Use wa.me URL with encodeURIComponent for WhatsApp sharing.",
    "Use HTML canvas rendering for downloadable share card images.",
    "Google Sign-In/OAuth requires external network access and third-party integration; this may conflict with fully offline-first/no-external-dependency goals and needs an explicit decision on allowed online-only features.",
    "Relax gated UX flow: generation is allowed without login; only saving, premium template exports, and advanced features require authentication.",
    "Add QR code generation locally (client-side) with no external API dependencies to preserve offline-friendly behavior.",
    "Add SEO meta tags (title/description) directly in index.html head.",
    "User chose Option 2: implement the premium Canva/Instagram-style card system as a separate standalone card designer module inside the app (not just upgrading the existing card output flow).",
    "Google Analytics (gtag.js) requires loading scripts from googletagmanager.com; this introduces an external network dependency and may conflict with offline-first/no-external-dependency goals—decide whether analytics is allowed as an online-only enhancement.",
    "Razorpay subscriptions require online backend components: subscription creation, webhook verification, and secure server-side signature checks; cannot be fully offline-first."
