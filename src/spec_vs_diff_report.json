  "summary": "Diff implements a new Prompt Studio mode with prompt input + examples, deterministic prompt analysis, local/rule-based content generation (title/message/footer with WishMint branding), a detected-style UI summary, an editor panel (edit text + tone + regenerate), event→theme auto-recommendation, and 3 generated variation params. Some acceptance criteria appear only partially covered or not evidenced (notably premium export gating/watermark+resolution, premium-only Coming Soon gating, and ensuring variations differ in typography/color).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Prompt Mode renders 3 unique card design variations with different layout compositions and different typography/color treatments (not just minor offsets), maintaining strict hierarchy and preventing overlap.",
      "reason": "While 3 variation parameter sets are generated, the diff evidence only shows changes in decorationOffset/vignetteIntensity/glowIntensity/layoutVariant. No evidence that typography pairings or color treatments change per variation (as required), nor evidence that layoutVariant is actually applied in rendering logic.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-9",
      "requirement": "Apply premium export rules to Prompt Mode downloads: free users get limited-resolution export and/or watermark; premium users get HD export and watermark removal; anonymous/demo download still requires sign-in; reuse existing entitlements.",
      "reason": "Although canvas export supports options for resolution and watermark and OutputSection imports/useEntitlements, the diff summary does not show download/export logic that conditionally sets resolution/watermark based on entitlements for Prompt Mode, or preserves the sign-in gating for anonymous users.",

      "requirement": "Add UI placeholders for Video invitation option and Voice message card option in the premium area as Coming Soon items gated behind premium.",
      "reason": "The Coming Soon buttons/toast are implemented, but there is no evidence they are gated behind premium/entitlements (i.e., only shown in premium area or disabled/hidden for non-premium users).",
