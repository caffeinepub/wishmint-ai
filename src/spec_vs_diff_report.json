  "summary": "REQ-62 appears implemented by adding the gtag.js snippet with measurement ID G-ZPB7R21LJ4 to frontend/index.html. REQ-63 is partially addressed by expanding CSP in frontend/.ic-assets.json to allow googletagmanager and some Google Analytics endpoints, but the CSP may still be missing endpoints commonly required for GA measurement collection.",

      "id": "REQ-63",
      "requirement": "Update the deployed frontend Content Security Policy (CSP) configuration to allow loading and using Google Analytics resources required by gtag.js, without breaking existing Internet Identity and app functionality.",
      "reason": "The CSP allows connect-src to https://www.google-analytics.com, https://analytics.google.com, and https://www.googletagmanager.com, but does not include wildcard subdomains that are commonly used for GA collection (e.g., region-specific google-analytics domains) nor other commonly used related endpoints. Based on the diff alone, it's not clear that all GA-initiated measurement requests will avoid CSP blocking as required by the acceptance criteria.",
