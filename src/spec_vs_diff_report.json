  "summary": "REQ-82 and REQ-83 are clearly implemented (viewport meta tag updated; global overflow-x prevention + #root sizing added). The diff also includes some layout-related class changes in sections, but the requested full-screen premium gradient coverage (REQ-84) and the comprehensive audit/elimination of fixed-width/overflow-causing elements (REQ-85/REQ-86) are not fully verifiable from the provided diff summary. Several unrelated product/behavior changes were introduced (demo/anon capability changes, auth-related behavior, new UI/sections/content, confetti/music, new hooks/components).",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-84",
      "requirement": "Ensure the premium dark gradient background covers the full screen width/height on mobile by applying the background to either body or a single full-width top-level wrapper (min-height: 100vh), without introducing horizontal overflow.",
      "reason": "The diff shows body uses `bg-background` (solid) and individual sections (e.g., Hero/SurpriseView) apply their own gradients, but it does not clearly show a single global/top-level wrapper or body-level gradient that guarantees full-screen coverage across the entire app on mobile (especially outside the Hero/Surprise routes). App.tsx is truncated, so the presence of a global background wrapper cannot be confirmed.",

      "requirement": "Audit and fix layout containers/sections to remove non-responsive fixed width constraints (e.g., w-[400px]/w-[420px]/w-[450px]/problematic max-w) and replace with responsive patterns so mobile does not overflow.",
      "reason": "Some sections show `w-full`/responsive padding updates, but the diff summary does not provide evidence of a full audit or that no fixed-width Tailwind classes remain across the main layout/sections. Many relevant files are not shown or are truncated.",
