  "summary": "The diff implements the new navigation UX components (sticky navbar with hamburger menu, scroll progress bar, floating Back to Top and “🎂 Create Wish” buttons) plus smooth-scroll utilities and scroll-spy highlighting. Anchor IDs and sticky-header offsets are added for several sections, but the diff evidence does not confirm all required section IDs (/marketplace in particular) nor that the special /pricing pseudo-route behavior in App.tsx is preserved. Additionally, multiple non-requested section redesign/feature changes appear in the modified-file summaries.",

      "reason": "The diff shows IDs added for home/create-wish/templates/pricing/dashboard/faq, but no diff evidence shows an element with id=\"marketplace\". Also, App.tsx is truncated and does not show the /pricing pseudo-route scroll+modal behavior being preserved.",
